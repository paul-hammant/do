          <p>I visit your enterprise software team, to help you change your branching model to <strong>Trunk-Based Development</strong> (TBD). I come to an understanding of how you develop and deploy software, with lots of questions to stakeholders and leaders,
            and then come up with a plan that gets you to your goals. Other than Trunk-Based Development, areas for questions, recommendation (and training) often stray into:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Branch by Abstraction</strong> (I was the pioneer), and <strong>Feature Flags/Toggles</strong> (goes hand in hand)</li>
            <li>A second pivot to a <strong>Monorepo</strong> design and optionally a <strong>directed graph build system like Buck or Bazel</strong></li>
            <li>Regular <strong>DevOps</strong> aspects around how to engineer <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>, and scaled <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> infra</li>
            <li><strong>Agile enablement</strong> factors, including the flow of stories from backlog into development</li>
            <li>Good <strong>Behavior Driven Development (BDD)</strong> phrasing for work - for the least amount of defects during development</li>
            <li><strong>Speedy test automation</strong>, featuring the correct testing technologies and <strong>Service Virtualization</strong></li>
            <li>economic benefits for the proposed changes</li>
            <li>case studies that show the way, both industry ones and those I was pivotal for, myself</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I have performed many assessments over the years. The beginning of those was via <strong>ThoughtWorks</strong> (a well known consultancy), twelve years ago, bore the title <strong>Agile assessments</strong>. Later ThoughtWorks would sell <strong>Continuous Delivery (CD) assessments</strong>            as the techniques emerged and Jez Humble and Dave Farley’s CD book came out (that uses some of my diagrams). Most recently, ThoughtWorks sold <strong>DevOps assessments</strong>, extending the pieces that came before. Many of those were as
            a ‘Principal Consultant’, but more recently some have been as a solo operator.</p>
          <p>I have presented findings to CEOs, CIOs and executive teams. I have seen clients say ‘yes’ to everything I have recommended, and implement them. I have also seen clients struggle to implement changes as their commitments, constraints and old
            habits put pressure on them to maintain the status quo. I have crafted my practice and honed my approach after tens of these assessments rather than break through to a higher-throughput place. Many times I have done follow-up visits to help
            measure progress towards goals for clients that want to run the execution of the plan on their own.</p>
          <h2 id="case-studies"><a class="header-anchor" href="#case-studies">¶</a>Case studies</h2>
          <p>I have brief case studies for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/bofa-platform-case-study/">A foreign exchange (FX) trading bank</a> - where I personally described <strong>Branch by Abstraction</strong> to the client, and oversaw its implementation for two non-functional abstractions concurrently.</li>
            <li><a href="/airline-case-study/">An airline</a> - where I personally described <strong>Branch by Abstraction</strong> to the client, did the setup, and was tech-lead for one of the many concurrent functional abstractions myself.</li>
            <li><a href="/hedgeserv-innovations/">A fin-tech startup</a> - were already doing TBD before I arrived (as Snr. Dir. of Engineering), but I made a few small tweaks and introduced <strong>Branch by Abstraction</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="otherwise-credentialing-myself"><a class="header-anchor" href="#otherwise-credentialing-myself">¶</a>Otherwise credentialing myself</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I lead the creation of the info portal <a href="https://TrunkBasedDevelopment.com" target="_blank" rel="external">TrunkBasedDevelopment.com</a></li>
            <li>I am the person who’s <a href="/about#trunk-based-development-again">written most about Trunk-Based Development, generally</a></li>
            <li>I have implemented Trunk-Based Development migration plans for large enterprise development teams many times</li>
            <li>I am the first person to write about <a href="/about#branch-by-abstraction-first-blogger">Branch by Abstraction</a>, which former colleagues Martin Fowler and Jez Humble went on to write about too.</li>
            <li>I am able to help you move past simple Trunk Based Development and towards Google’s Monorepo design.</li>
            <li>I know how to massively reduce your test automation times using <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/rise-test-impact-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Test Impact Analysis</a> (TIA)</li>
            <li>I have previously had Snr. Director of Engineering (2x), Chief Science Officer and Head of Development roles (but have otherwise coded during and before/after work for twenty-eight years)</li>
            <li>I have consulted inside Google (the <a href="https://mike-bland.com/2012/07/10/test-mercenaries.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Test Mercenaries</a> team), a few US banks, a famous US budget airline, retailers, fin-tech and other startups</li>
            <li>I worked at industry the leading ThoughtWorks as mentioned, making my contributions to their canon</li>
            <li>I co-created the industry standard web testing technology, <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Selenium</a>, back in 2004</li>
            <li>I co-created the <a href="/about#picocontainer-and-dependency-injection">first Dependency Injection Container that used Constructor Injection</a> in 2003</li>
            <li>I and my materials am referenced in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912" target="_blank" rel="external">Continuous Delivery</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425"

            <li>I <a href="https://paulhammant.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">have been blogging</a> about a wide range of software development topics since 2002</li>
          </ul>
          <p>New York is my base, but I frequently travel to client sites in the USA. I also have clients outside the USA.</p>
